# minimal-masonry

Minimal implementation of the [masonry layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Masonry_Layout).

Note: There is [a proposal](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4650) to implement the `masonry` layout for CSS grid but it's [only implemented in Safari](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_masonry-auto-flow) as of June 2024.
