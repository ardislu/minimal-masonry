# minimal-masonry

Minimal implementation of the [masonry layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Masonry_Layout).

Note: There is a draft ([CSS Grid Layout Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/)) to implement the `masonry` layout for CSS grid but it's [only implemented in Safari](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Masonry_layout#browser_compatibility) as of January 2025.
